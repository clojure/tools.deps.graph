tools.deps.graph
========================================

A tool for making deps.edn dependency graphs.

![Deps](deps.png)

# Dependencies

tools.deps.graph uses [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/) to generate images. You can find a list of platform-specific installations at https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/.

# Usage

Add tools.deps.graph as an alias in your ~/.clojure/deps.edn so it's available in any project:

```clojure
{...
 :aliases
 {:graph {:deps {org.clojure/tools.deps.graph {:mvn/version "1.0.46"}}
          :main-opts ["-m" "clojure.tools.deps.graph"]}}}
```

Run it in your current project:

```
clj -A:graph <options>
```

If no options are provided, tools.deps.graph will create a dependency graph for the current project and display it. Ctrl-C to quit.

Options:

* -d DEPSFILE - deps.edn file to read, default=deps.edn
* -t - Trace mode, will output one image per expansion step
* -f TRACEFILE - Trace file mode - read trace file, don't use deps.edn file
* -o FILE - Output file, in trace mode, required and will create N images with this as a prefix
* -a - Concatenated alias names to enable when reading deps file
* --trace-omit - Comma-delimited list of libs to skip in trace images"
* --size- Add jar size info to dep graph"

# Examples

Show dependency graph for current project:

```
clj -A:graph
```

Show dependency graph for current project with jar sizes:

```
clj -A:graph -o deps.png
```

Save dependency graph to deps.png for current project:

```
clj -A:graph -o deps.png --size
```

Read mydeps.edn, create deps graph, output image to mydeps.png:

```
clj -A:graph -d mydeps.edn -o mydeps.png
```

Read deps.edn, trace expansion, output steps as trace100.png, trace101.png, ... :

```
clj -A:graph -t -o trace
```

Read mydeps.edn, trace expansion, output trace100.png, ... :

```
clj -A:graph -d mydeps.edn -t -o trace
```

Use -Strace to output a trace.edn file.
Read trace.edn file, output trace100.png, ...

```
clj -Strace
clj -A:graph -f trace.edn -o trace
```

# Release Information

This project follows the version scheme MAJOR.MINOR.COMMITS where MAJOR and MINOR provide some relative indication of the size of the change, but do not follow semantic versioning. In general, all changes endeavor to be non-breaking (by moving to new names rather than by breaking existing names). COMMITS is an ever-increasing counter of commits since the beginning of this repository.

Latest release: 1.0.46
